# Android.KisH
IMPORTANT: This is a project I developed for my Degree in Multiplatform App Development. I uploaded the first versions (https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KisHCaptura and https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KantoisHere) BEFORE PokemonGO was even announced, although it is a very similar idea. The map is divided into zones and depending on the user's location the app will display different AR pokemon so they can be captured and added to the user's Team. This project implements RESTful service, GEO Location from Google Services and Augmented Reality using Vuforia for Unity.
- https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KisH-AR-GeoLoc-RESTful/tree/master/KantoisHere is the Android Aplication, it includes geoLocation.
- https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KisH-AR-GeoLoc-RESTful/tree/master/KisHCaptura is the Activity which launches the AR screen, recieves the code for the 3d model the target must display
- https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KisH-AR-GeoLoc-RESTful/tree/master/TargetClass Vuforia class for the Target which displays different models dynamically
- https://github.com/AndreaRP/Android.KisH-AR-GeoLoc-RESTful/tree/master/PHP php scripts on the server. Intermediate between Android app and MySQL DB

All the 3d models I used can be downloaded freely from http://roestudios.co.uk/project/3d-pokemon-models/ Thanks a lot guys!!
